Same https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun tool, but for automation:
added 10 000 new words + some debug mode detection;
suppressed ~all exceptions;
url?parameter is now printed in the stdout for quick extraction;
silence mode is enabled by default, - program will output only found parameters;
time.sleep(30) when 429 code reduced to 15.

Thanks to s0md3v! The tool is great for ordinary URLs but there was a need to improve it for massive scan.
